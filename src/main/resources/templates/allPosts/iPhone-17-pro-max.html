                Specifications</p>
            <p>Apple enthusiasts eagerly await each iPhone launch, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max promises to deliver on the
                high
                expectations set by previous models. Expected to release in <b>September 2025</b>, the iPhone 17 Pro Max
                is
                speculated to come with significant improvements across all major aspects, from display and camera
                quality
                to battery life and performance.</p>

            <h2 id="Release_date">Release Date in India</h2>
            <p>The iPhone 17 Pro Max will likely follow Apple’s usual September release pattern, with availability in
                India
                shortly after the global launch. The exact release date hasn’t been confirmed, but Apple typically holds
                its
                major event in early September, which means Indian customers can expect it in stores by <b>late
                    September or
                    early October</b>.</p>

            <h2>iPhone 17 Pro Max Price in India</h2>
            <p id="price">The price for the iPhone 17 Pro Max is estimated to range from <b>₹1,50,000 to ₹2,00,000</b>
                depending on storage configurations and any potential regional price adjustments. While this price point
                positions it as a luxury device, Apple’s loyalty in the Indian market, along with financing options,
                often
                makes this range accessible for those looking to upgrade.</p>
